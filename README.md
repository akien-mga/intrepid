# Intrepid

This is the source code of a computer game **Intrepid**. You can download the game from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/992860/Intrepid/) or directly from [here](https://miskatonicstudio.com/downloads/Intrepid_1.0.2_windows_linux.zip).

The source code does not contain the whole history of Intrepid's development. The main reason is that the `.git` folder contained all the changes applied to binary resources (images, models), which significantly increased its size, but didn't bring any value.

## Licenses:

While many of the resources used in the game are public domain, please consider crediting their original authors if you decide to use them for your projects.

### Code

The game uses a CRT shader created by [AaronWizard](https://github.com/AaronWizard). It is licensed under the MIT license and available on GitHub: [CRTScreenShader](https://github.com/AaronWizard/CRTScreenShader).

The remaining code used in the game has been created by Paweł Fertyk and Stanisław Karlik and is public domain.

### Images

Miskatonic Studio's logo is included in this repository, but it cannot be used without a direct permission from Miskatonic Studio.

Images of the yellow planet and 2 moons have been created by Paweł Fertyk using [Fracplanet](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fracplanet/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and are public domain. The yellow planet uses a cloud texture created by NASA: [Blue Marble](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=57747).

Other images have been created by [Joseph Diaz](https://www.artstation.com/josephdiaz) and [Zaven Boyrazian](https://www.artstation.com/cysis145). All of them (including the game's icon and logo) are public domain.

### Models

The model of a human being was created by Paweł Fertyk and was strongly inspired by the bat creature's model from Ben Simmonds' book: [Blender Master Class](https://nostarch.com/blendermasterclass). The model in this repository is public domain, while the original is licensed under Creative Commons non-commercial attribution license (CC-BY-NC).

Other 3D models have been created by [Zaven Boyrazian](https://www.artstation.com/cysis145) and are public domain.
